When do I take these covid tests?

Where do I turn them into?

Is there any fasting or eating requirments?  No solid foods after midnight.  Clear liquids ok within 4 hours before surgery start time.

Does the doctor have my wife's number to call after the surgery?

What do I bring to the hospital?  Clothes etc?

Do I check in at Douglas hospital?  5:15   Says 2nd floor of Douglas Hospital.  Where?

If I experience numbness of face, tingling, or cramping, I'm supposed to take a calcium tablet.  Where do I get these?
